    For my final project at a full-stack development bootcamp hosted by Binar
    Academy, I collaborated with a team of five to create a web application
    using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Although
    the website itself is no longer active, the codebase is accessible for
    review. You can explore the frontend and backend repositories to understand
    our project&apos;s structure, features, and the technologies we implemented.
    Here are the links to the repositories: <br /> 1. Frontend:{" "}

    99 Apparel is an elegantly designed company profile website developed using
    React.js, focusing solely on front-end functionalities to highlight the
    brand‚Äôs fashion offerings. The site features a clean, modern user interface
    that efficiently showcases various clothing collections through a
    well-organized layout and high-quality images. This project demonstrates
    advanced usage of React.js to create a responsive and visually appealing
    digital presence for the brand, emphasizing usability and aesthetic appeal.

    , specifically designed for mobile use. It‚Äôs a simple site that does its
    job, but looking back, I see plenty of room for improvement. Now, with more
    experience and a better grasp of the technology, I‚Äôm excited about the
